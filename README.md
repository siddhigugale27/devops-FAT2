DevOps Assignment

1. Five DevOps Concepts 

1. Continuous Integration (CI)  
   Frequently testing and merging code to avoid conflicts.  
   CI tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, and GitLab CI automate testing and integration.

2. Continuous Deployment (CD)   
   Automatically deploying successfully tested code into production without manual steps.  
   Helps deliver updates faster and more reliably.

3. Version Control (Git)   
   Git tracks code changes, enables collaboration, and maintains project history.  
   Developers can work on separate features without disturbing each other.

4. Containerization (Docker)   
   Docker packages applications with all dependencies into portable containers.  
   Ensures the same behavior across Mac, Windows, Linux, servers, and cloud systems.

5. Automation   
   Eliminates repetitive manual work.  
   Used for automated building, testing, monitoring, and deployment tasks.

 2. How I Completed This Assignment (Extended Explanation)

Docker Commands Used
```bash
docker build -t devops-assignment .
docker tag devops-assignment maulipatil2/devops-assignment:v1
docker push maulipatil2/devops-assignment:v1
```

 What These Docker Commands Do
- docker build → Creates a Docker image using the Dockerfile.  
- docker tag → Assigns a version tag (v1) for pushing to Docker Hub.  
- docker push → Uploads the image to my Docker Hub repository.  

This gave me hands-on experience in building and sharing container images.

Git Commands Used
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/MauliPatil2/devops-demo-app
git push -u origin main
```

What These Git Commands Do
- git init → Creates a new Git repository.  
- git add → Stages all files for commit.  
- git commit → Saves project changes in Git history.  
- git remote add origin → Connects the project to GitHub.  
- git push → Uploads code to GitHub.

This taught me proper version control workflow used in software development.


3. What I Learned?

- Learned how to build, tag, and upload Docker images.  
- Understood basic Linux commands and how they work inside a container.  
- Learned how Git and GitHub manage source code effectively.  
- Understood Docker image versioning (v1, v2, etc.).  
- Learned how Docker Hub acts as a cloud registry for storing images.  
- Understood the DevOps pipeline: Build → Tag → Push → Pull → Run.  
- Experienced how automation makes deployments faster and error-free.  
- Understood how teams collaborate using Git branches and commits.  
- Saw how DevOps brings together development, version control, and containerization.  

This assignment helped me understand real DevOps practices and how modern applications are built, packaged, and deployed.
